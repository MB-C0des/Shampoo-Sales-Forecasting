# Shampoo-Sales-Forecasting

**Shampoo Sales Forecasting**

**Overview**

This project utilises Python and ML concepts to generate a Rolling forecast ARIMA model for the prediction of shampoo sales. Facebook's Prophet model is also deployed for the reperformance of this analysis. Both models demonstrate their useful predictive capabilities. Insightful visualisations have been generated to conceptualise the results of this study.
